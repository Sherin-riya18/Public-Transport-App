#Public Transport Tracker
Public Transport Tracker is a simple frontend web application developed using React.js in Visual Studio Code. This app simulates a transport tracking system where users can filter transport options based on location, view transport details, receive alert notifications when a transport is nearing, and simulate bookings. All data is handled using static JSON files, providing a fast and smooth user experience. The project showcases key features like dynamic UI rendering, location-based filtering, and interactive transport alerts, making it a lightweight yet functional demo of a transport information system.
